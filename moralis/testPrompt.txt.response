The city of Deleset was once a great center of learning and culture, home to the House of the Fey Serpent, one of the most powerful and respected families in all of the Five Kingdoms. But in 15 AC, the city was destroyed in a cataclysmic event that has been remembered ever since as The Fall of Deleset.

The cause of the city's destruction is still a matter of debate, but most historians believe that it was destroyed by a combination of fire and ice magic unleashed by Farseer Illidus Terrikon, the last great son of the House of the Fey Serpent. Terrikon was attempting to avenge the death of his uncle, who was killed by the king of Deleset, and his magic caused the city to crumble and fall into the sea.
