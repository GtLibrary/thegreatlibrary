Shall I close my eyes and remember? Remember standing on the balcony outside my room? And see how my vision came to pass! How my uncle ignored my warnings and brought down his fire and ice—and sowed the gods’ own wrath. Shall I close my eyes and see the flames? How I see them rage. And how I see my city crumble and fall into the sea? Oh Deleset? How long must I weep your broken towers, now lost to the eastern sea?
—From The Fall of Delaset by Farseer Illidus Terrikon, the last great son of the House of the Fey Serpent, circa 15 AC.
